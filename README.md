# Experimental Applications of ML/NN simulators 
This repository contains my project for the *Machine Learning course* of my Master's degree in Data Science and Business Informatics at Universit√† di Pisa.
The aim of this project is to conduct an a comprehensive analysis and comparison of different
models, namely **Random Forest**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Multi-Layer Perceptron
(MLP)**. In the first part, we focus on a *classification* task using benchmark Monk datasets, which is
achieved through empirical trials. The second part shifts attention towards a *multivariate
regression* task using the ML-CUP dataset. This involves a process consisting of preliminary
experimental trials, parameter fine-tuning, and an in-depth comparison among the models.
The code was developed in *Python* (Jupyter Notebook). Specific libraries utilizied for building machine learning models, including *Keras* for MLP, *TensorFlow* for Random Forest, *Scikit-Learn* for SVM, and *KerasTuner* for GridSearch.

## Abstract
This report presents the development and performance comparison of multiple models. The
validation technique employed involved a systematic approach, including preliminary experimental
trials, grid search with different levels of granularity, and a 5-fold cross-validation,
followed by the final model assessment. Using this approach, we identified the optimal
model for the ML-CUP task, which turned out to be a Support Vector Machine (SVM)
with a rbf kernel function.

## Repository Overview

**Monk datasets**:
* Monk.ipynb : contains the implementation of Random Forest, SVM, and MLP for three monk datasets

**ML-CUP**:
* RandomForest.ipynb : contains the implementation of Random Forest for ML-CUP
* SVM.ipynb : contains the implementation of SVM for ML-CUP
* MLP.ipynb : contains the implementation of MLP for ML-CUP
* TestBlindSet.ipynb : contains the implementation of SVM with rbf kernel function for blind test set (ML-CUP)
